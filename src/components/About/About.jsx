  <section id="about" className="about-section">
      <p>Hello! I am a developer with 3 years of&nbsp;experience building modern web applications using SvelteKit, as well as React and TypeScript. I focus on creating clean, component-based interfaces, implementing client-side routing, and delivering interactive, user-friendly UI.
        </p><br/><p>
        I care about accessibility, performance and Core Web Vitals, and I enjoy collaborating with&nbsp;teams to turn ideas into high-quality, user-focused products.<br/>
      </p><br/><p>
      If you value both technical quality and&nbsp;teamwork, I’d be happy to connect.
     
{/* 
      My background includes strong experience with semantic markup and styling, combined with JavaScript-driven interaction, performance optimization, and component-based development. <br/>
      I pay close attention to performance and usability, including optimizing Core Web Vitals, and collaborate closely with the team to ensure the final product aligns with both user needs and product goals.<br/>
      It is important for me to create interfaces that not&nbsp;only look good, but are also accessible, well-structured and&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;maintain.  */}
